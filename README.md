# advent of code 2021
solving https://adventofcode.com/ challenges, mostly in (bad, nooby) OCaml  
  
won't be able to stick do the 1-per-day schedule so a reasonable target is to finish AOC 2021 by end-Jan 2022  

will solve mostly when I'm bored of other work

## solution mood meter
in an effort to resist the urge of constantly improving and cleaning up my solutions (because i don't have the time to spare), i am enforcing a strict `git push`-and-never-touch-the-file-again rule the instant my code produces correct output

as a coping mechanism i will instead list how each solution makes me feel

| ----------- | ----------- |
| [ocaml_01 (A+B)](https://github.com/kokrui/aoc/blob/main/01/ocaml_01.ml) | ok, aoc seems fun |
| [ocaml_02 (A+B)](https://github.com/kokrui/aoc/blob/main/02/ocaml_02.ml) | good, i'm happy that i'm starting to write tail-recursive functions by default |
| [ocaml_03A](https://github.com/kokrui/aoc/blob/main/03/ocaml_03A.ml) | i tried to do imperative style but this is truly horrific, should've done aoc with haskell |
| [ocaml_03B](https://github.com/kokrui/aoc/blob/main/03/ocaml_03B.ml) | back to normal FP style, prolly didn't need to do the custom types tho, but happier |
| [ocaml_04A](https://github.com/kokrui/aoc/blob/c40fea6445d1d04d8ebccbab27e1abce1274a813/04/ocaml_04A.ml) | first time using OCaml where I was truly hardstuck on a logic bug (which is a good thing and credit to FP), so I kept the debug code to remind myself |
| [ocaml_04B](https://github.com/kokrui/aoc/blob/main/04/ocaml_04.ml) | pretty good, had to catch bug which i denoted in comment but did it quicker than i expected in hindsight |
